ATM project

this program acts as a simple ATM machine with looping options output, until user exits on their own

**was not allowed to use multiple return or exit statements, focus was on if...else

**PIN must be between 1000-9999

**gives 2 chances for valid PIN, and 2 more for accurate PIN after account creation

any feedback is welcomed
